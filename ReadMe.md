Here are some advantages of Quick Sort:
	-Fast and efficient
	-Space complexity (in-place sorting)
	-Efficient for large datasets
	-No additional memory overhead
	-Leverages divide-and-conquer strategy

Here are some disadvantages of Quick Sort:
	-Unstable
	-Worst-case time complexity (O(n^2))
	-Dependent on pivot selection
	-Less suitable for linked lists
	-Requires additional memory for the call stack in recursive implementations
	
Here are some sorting algorithms:
	-Bubble sort: Compares elements to bubble up the maximum to the end.
	-Selection sort: Compares elements to find the minimum element in the unsorted part and places that 				element in the sorted part.
	-Insertion sort: Compares elements to determine the position of an element in the partially sorted 				   array.
	-Merge sort: Compares elements of two sorted halves to merge them into the final sorted array.
	-Quick sort: Compares elements to partition the unsorted array into two different halves around the 			pivot.
	-Heapsort: Compares elements during the heapify process to place the elements at the correct position 			in the sorted array.
	
In addition to the comparison operations, these sorting algorithms use these methods to implement the sorting:
	-Bubble sort: Swapping
	-Selection sort: Swapping
	-Insertion sort: Shifting
	-Merge sort: Allocation of extra memory and data copy.
	-Quicksort: Swapping
	-Heapsort: Swapping
